    brief:
      'FlightView is a key system used by Vietjet to track and update operational information on every single flight in the network every day.\n The new FlightView has to be more user-friendly with a multiple group of users of different backgrounds and responsibilities (from ground services to senior management). At the same time, the redesigned application has to provide improvement on productivity of users, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.',
    solution:
      'Our first task was to conduct extensive research on different process flows and user behaviours when interacting with FlightView. The team placed the emphasis on customisability, allowing users of different needs to choose the right amount of key information that is necessary for their daily activities. The new interface will also have to work well across platforms (desktop, tablet and mobile), providing consistent experience. Dinovative then completely overhauled FlightView’s interface, implementing changes based on observations from research while retaining key elements from Vietjet’s branding guidelines. Clean, minimal and easy-to-understand, the design encourages users to optimize the information available, allowing them to complete their tasks quickly with fewer mistakes.',

    brief: 'WMC Prestige is a luxury loyalty program. After running for 15 years, WMC wanted an upgrade to give it members added flexibility and benefits, utilising the different services managed by the company. Previously, members only received preferred recognition and benefits at WMC-managed restaurants. Under the new scheme, loyal customers now enjoy special discounts and promotions across a network of 17 restaurants, 4 properties (hotels and serviced apartments) and 2 spas.',
    solution: 'Dinovative worked with business to design a program that would integrate benefits from all participating services. Customer data from different sources were consolidated into one centrally -managed database. Another important component of the project included operational tools for WMC management team, including fully customisable marketing functions, reports and business intelligence. We also designed and developed a new WMC Prestige app (for both iOS and Android), implementing the WMC branding guidelines and the integrated benefit system to create a welcoming platform that is capable of attracting and engaging loyal customers.',
